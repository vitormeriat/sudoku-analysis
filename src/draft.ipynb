    "First things first. If you are not familiar with the rules of a sudoku puzzle, don’t be frightened. They are quite simple:\n",
    "You must fill the boxes of a 9x9 grid with numbers from 1 to 9 in a way that there are no recurring numbers in each row, column, and 3x3 block.\n",
    "If you take a look at the image, the only number that fits into the top left box is two since it’s the only one that doesn’t appear in this row, column and box.\n",

    "### Data Structure\n",
    "To solve this programmatically for a 9x9 grid, I needed a data structure for the original, unsolved Grid and another grid for Possible Values. Each grid was a python 2-D list. The data structure to hold the grid and list of possibles took me awhile to decide upon. In the end, a 2D array of 9x9 lists worked best for me, and I calculated the necessary indexes when the “cubes”, aka 3x3 submatrix or mini-grids, needed to be inspected.\n",

    "\n",
    "I needed to track the active Grid and a grid of Possible Values. At first I was going to process the Grid iteratively, but then it became apparent that only the Possible Values grid need to be updated. If the Possible Values resulted in one number, then the cell is solved. Assign that value to the active Grid and eliminate that value from the other Possible Values in the corresponding Row, Column, and “Cube” (Please refer to the highlighted areas in the graphic below). My definition of a “cube” is a 3x3 submatrix within the 9x9 original grid. Nine “cubes” fit in the grid.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Possible Values are in small font. In the graphic, the cell being inspected is (3, 5) or the 4th row, 6th column and is highlighted in purple. If that inspected cell value is determined to be “7”, then a “7” cannot be in any cell in Row 3, nor Column 5, nor the middle “Cube.” Keep searching for Possible Values where the count is 1, update the Grid and Possible Values, until the puzzle is solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate the Possible Values, I used python’s set() feature. For each of the 81 cells, I would start with full set of 1–9 numbers and remove() those numbers that were not logically possible using set() subtraction.\n",
    "If a working Grid’s cell has the correct value, then there are no Possible Values, and thus assigned a 0. Otherwise, each cell is assigned the full set of numbers from 1 to 9 minus the “conflicts” in each Row, Cell, and Cube by using set() subtraction in turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iteration vs Recursion for the Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "After I programmatically solved sudoku, a colleague reminded me of the N-Queens backtracking algorithm, where recursion can be used. He also pointed out that the worst case complexity is O(81!).\n",
    "To me, this seems like a brute force method to try all possibilities. Since there are many relationships between numbers, they should be analyzed before “platonic” guesses should be attempted. This reminds me (for lack of a better name), my “value in a cube row/column” trick was not implemented. If a value is known in 2 out of 3 in a contiguous, cubic row/column (3x1 or 1x3 submatrix), the value has to be in the remaining row/column, respectively). This trick would solve a few more sudoku puzzles, and I’m sure other other tricks exist as well. I am not a sudoku expert, but I suppose the N-Queens method could be used as a last-resort rather than as the #1 choice as a hybrid implementation. Or, platonic iteration could be tried further as well.\n",
    "In general, I still prefer iteration over recursion because the latter takes too much stack and memory resources. Although recursion is useful in some applications, and code can look cleaner, it can be harder to debug if the base case is set incorrectly."
